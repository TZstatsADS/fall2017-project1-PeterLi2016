### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2017

+ Projec title: Why Trump's Inaugaration Speech Makes Him Unique
+ This project is conducted by Peter Li (pwl2107)
+ Project summary: Through the use of sentiment analysis and word clouds, we analyze the similarities and disimilarities between Trump's speech and those of his predecessors. Through such, we conclude that Donald Trump's speech is similar to other speechs in terms of structure (sentence length variation and emotion distribution). However, Trump's speech differs greatly in terms of content and sophistication. Trump tends to have shorter sentences, implying lower sophistication. And his content seems very superficial (word cloud shows very little variation in terms of content) and distinct (clustered into group with fewest other presidents).
